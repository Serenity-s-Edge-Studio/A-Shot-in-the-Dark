  description: A shotgun shell, shotshell or simply shell is a type of rimmed, cylindrical
    (straight-walled) cartridges used specifically by shotguns, and is typically
    loaded with numerous small, pellet-like spherical sub-projectiles called shots,
    fired through a smoothbore barrel with a tapered constriction at the muzzle to
    regulate the extent of scattering. A shell can sometimes also contain only a
    single large solid projectile known as a slug, fired usually through a rifled
    slug barrel. The shell casing usually consist of a paper or plastic tube mounted
    on a brass base holding a primer, and the shots are typically contained by a
    wadding/sabot inside the case. The caliber of the shotshell is known as its gauge.
