  description: The standard issue military .45 ACP round has a 230-grain bullet that
    travels at approximately 830 feet per second when fired from the government issue
    M1911A1 pistol. It operates at a relatively low maximum chamber pressure rating
    of 21,000 psi (145 MPa) (compared to 35,000 psi/241 MPa for 9mm Parabellum and
    .40 S&W), which due to a low bolt thrust helps extend service life of weapons.
    Due to standard pressure .45 ACP rounds being inherently subsonic when fired
    from handguns and submachine guns, it is a useful caliber for suppressed weapons
    to eliminate the sonic boom.
